Linear Regression with Gradient Descent for MPG Prediction
This project focuses on building a linear regression model using the gradient descent optimization method to predict the Miles Per Gallon (MPG) of vehicles. The primary goal is to create an accurate and efficient model that can estimate fuel efficiency based on various features.

Overview
Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm, and this project specifically implements it using the gradient descent optimization technique. MPG is chosen as the dependent variable, and the model aims to capture the relationship between MPG and other independent features. The project involves crucial data preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, transformation, and a comprehensive multivariate analysis.

Key Components
Data Cleaning
Before applying linear regression, the dataset undergoes a thorough data cleaning process. This involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring the dataset is in a suitable format for analysis. Clean and well-structured data is essential for training an effective machine learning model.

Data Transformation
To enhance the model's performance, various data transformation techniques are applied. This may include feature scaling, normalization, or encoding categorical variables. Transforming the data helps in achieving better convergence during the gradient descent process and improves the overall accuracy of the model.

Multivariate Analysis
Understanding the relationships between multiple independent variables and their impact on the dependent variable (MPG) is crucial. Multivariate analysis involves exploring correlations, identifying significant features, and ensuring that the selected variables collectively contribute to the model's predictive power.

Model Training with Gradient Descent
The linear regression model is trained using the gradient descent optimization method. This iterative algorithm minimizes the cost function, adjusting the model parameters to find the optimal values that best fit the data. The choice of the gradient descent method reflects a focus on efficiency and scalability for large datasets.
