Data-Analytics-Projects:

This repository is mainly for projects I have done under my Data Analysis program at Great Learning and my self learning.
These projects helped me understand and prepare for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects .
